# Module2_VBA_Challenge

## Overview of the Project

### Purpose
The Module 2 Challenge uses VBA macros to help Steve conduct an analysis of several stocks to determine what is the best option for his parent's investments. The analysis uses refactored macros, conditional formatting, and buttons to improve it's speed and usability.

## Results

### Stock Performance in 2017
A majority of the stocks in 2017 had a positive return in value. The tickers with the largest percent of returns include "DQ", "SEDG", and "ENPH". The stocks with the smallest percent of return include "TERP", "RUN", and "AY". 

### Stock Performance in 2018
In 2018, the percent of return for almost all stocks significantly decreased. The only two stocks that had a positive percent of return are the "RUN" and "ENPH" stocks. The rate of return for "ENPH" ranks high in both 2017 and 2018. Steve should look for investments within the "ENPH" ticker to give his parent's a greater return for their value.

### Comparison of Scripts
The refactored scripts require less time for the macro to process. The original macros run closer to one second while the refactored macros happenin less than half a second. Images A & B show the time it takes to run the macros using the refactored scripts.

## Summary

### Advantages of Refactoring Code
One of the main advantages of refactoring code is that it creates a more organized and cleaner code for Excel to run. This was demonstrated in our module challenge when we refactored the code and the running time took less than half a second.

### Disadvantages of Refactoring Code
One of the disadvantages or challenges of refactoring code is that we open the opportunity for error and bugs. While refactoring the code, I had to rewrite multiple lines of code to ensure that the "yearValue" variable was properly working. I had to test these a couple of times before actually getting it right so I can see this being difficult if we had to test every year in a larger data set.
